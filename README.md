### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research scientist in the [Brain Development and Education Lab](https://www.brainandeducation.com/) in the [Division of Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics](https://dbpeds.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where I develop statistical learning techniques and software for the analysis of neuroimaging data ðŸ§ . I also lead technical development of a web-based assessment platform for the deep phenotyping of dyslexia.
